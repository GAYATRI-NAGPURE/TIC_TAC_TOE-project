# TIC_TAC_TOE-project
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The game allows two players to take turns placing their marks ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If the board fills up before a player achieves victory, the game ends in a tie.
